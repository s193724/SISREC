COMPUTE USER SIMILARITY BASED ON COLUMNS:

solve the cold start problem by prompting user questions:

    location_user	where user wants to go?
    num_cities	How many different cities do you typically travel to each year?
    num_reviews_profile	Have you reviewed hotels before?
    num_helpful_votes_user	Do you often write detailed reviews that others find helpful?

LaTex formula for computing similarities for cold users based on metadata(no normalization in the code):
\[
\text{score}_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{sim}(u_{\text{new}}, u_i) \times r_{i,j}
\]

with normalization:

\[
\text{score}_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\text{sim}(u_{\text{new}}, u_i)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \text{sim}(u_{\text{new}}, u_k)} \times r_{i,j}
\]

 but also we can check what the user values and create a (composite rating) x hotel_class as weight it is important to use this variable as weight as a lot of users may indicate high standarts but aim for cheaper hotels which have a lower
 category and look for hotels and with similar reviews using the
 hotel x hotel similarity matrix:

    location,service,cleanliness,overall,value,location,sleep_quality,number_of_rooms,hotel_class_as_weight
formula for that in LaTex:

\text{weighted\_score} = \left(\frac{1}{7} \sum_{i=1}^{7} \text{preference}_i \right) \times \text{hotel\_class}

\text{weighted\_score} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{7} \text{preference}_i \right) \times \text{hotel\_class}

FOR USERS THAT ALREADY HAVE ACTIVITY are in the reviews dataser A COLLABORATION BASED SYSTEM:
 ITEM X USER MATRIX
 ITEM SIMILARITY MATRIX



 strategy approved I will make teh datasets smaller and experiment with different mixes
 asking a user a lot of questions is a good idea, user might not answer them all
 we will see!

 but I will create one matrix based on metadata for which I will ask for questions
 and also one with collaboration data for which I will ask questions to the new user as well
 I will regulate the influence of these two matrices using alfa beta as weighting parameters
